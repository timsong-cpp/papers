# Abstract
This paper proposes resolutions for [@LWG3509] and [@LWG3510].

# Discussion

The wording below clarifies that the partial application performed by range adaptor objects
is essentially identical to that performed by `bind_front`. (Indeed, it is
effectively a limited version of `bind_back`.) In particular, this means that
the bound arguments are captured by copy or move, and never by reference.
Invocation of the pipeline then either copies or moves the bound entities,
depending on the value category of the pipeline.

In other words,

```c++
auto c = /* some range */;
auto f = /* expensive-to-copy function object */;
c | transform(f); // copies f and then move it into the view

auto t = transform(f);  // copies f
c | t;  // copies f again from t
c | std::move(t); // moves f from t
```

For all but one range adaptor in the standard library, the bound arguments are
expected to be either function objects (which are expected to be cheap to copy
and are generally copied freely) or integer-like types (which should be cheap to copy).

`views::split`, where the pattern can be a range, is an interesting case for two reasons.
(The pattern can be an element as well, but that is not particularly interesting.)

- If the pattern is a C array, the decay-copy makes it into a pointer. As a
  result, the `split_view` construction might be ill-formed if the user actually
  meant to use the array as a range. For the most common case of string literals,
  using the array (including the terminating null character) as the pattern is
  likely unintended.

- If the pattern is an lvalue non-view range, the copy can make it a non-viewable
  range when the closure object is used as an rvalue:

  ```c++
  std::string s = "hello", s1 = "l";
  views::split(s, s1);    // OK
  s | views::split(s1);   // ill-formed under this wording; copy of s1 forwarded as rvalue
  auto adapt = views::split(s1);
  s | adapt;              // OK
  ```

  There does not appear to be a way to avoid this without making the following
  function template (which demonstrates an expected use of adaptor pipelines)
  always return something that holds a dangling reference:

  ```c++
  template<class Pattern>
  auto split_into_strings(Pattern p) {
    return views::split(p) | views::transform([](auto r){
      return std::string(r.begin(), ranges::next(r.begin(), r.end()));
    });
  }
  ```

In both cases, the workaround is to wrap the pattern in `views::all`, which also
clearly signifies the reference semantics of the capture. Having a compile-time
error, while perhaps less than ideal, seems to be preferable to silent dangling.

As range adaptor objects are customization point objects, and the use of
`bind_front`-like semantics means that they will be copied and invoked as
non-const lvalues and rvalues, this wording also resolves [@LWG3510] by
clarifying that customization point objects are invocable regardless of value
category or cv-qualification.


# Wording

This wording is relative to [@N4878].

- Edit [customization.point.object]{.sref} p4 as indicated:

::: bq

[3]{.pnum} All instances of a specific customization point object type shall be
equal ([concepts.equality]). [The effects of invoking different instances of a
specific customization point object type on the same arguments are equivalent.]{.diffins}

[4]{.pnum} The type `T` of a customization point object[, ignoring cv-qualifiers,]{.diffins} shall model
`invocable<const T&, Args...>`[, `invocable<T&, Args...>`, `invocable<T, Args...>`,
and `invocable<const T, Args...>`]{.diffins} ([concept.invocable]{.sref}) when the types in
`Args...` meet the requirements specified in that customization point object's
definition. When the types of `Args...` do not meet the customization point
object's requirements, `T` shall not have a function call operator that
participates in overload resolution. [The effect of invoking a customization
point object on any particular set of arguments is the same regardless of
the cv-qualification or value category of the customization point object.]{.diffins}

:::

- Edit [range.adaptor.object]{.sref} as indicated:

::: bq

[1]{.pnum} A _range adaptor closure object_ is a unary function object that
accepts a `viewable_足range` argument and returns a `view`. For a range adaptor
closure object `C` and an expression `R` such that `decltype((R))` models
`viewable_足range`, the following expressions are equivalent and yield a `view`:

```c++
C(R)
R | C
```

Given an additional range adaptor closure object `D`, the expression ` C | D` [is
well-formed and]{.diffdel} produces another range adaptor closure object [`E`.]{.diffins} [such that the
following two expressions are equivalent:]{.diffdel}

::: rm

```c++
R | C | D
R | (C | D)
```

:::

::: add

`E` is a perfect forwarding call wrapper ([func.require]{.sref}) with the following properties:

- Its target object is an object `d` of type `decay_t<decltype((D))>` direct-non-list-initialized with `D`.
- It has one bound argument entity, an object `c` of type `decay_t<decltype((C))>` direct-non-list-initialized with `C`.
- Its call pattern is `d(c(arg))`, where `arg` is the argument used in a function call expression of `E`.

The expression `C | D` is well-formed if and only if the initializations of the
state entities of `E` are all well-formed.

:::

[2]{.pnum}
A _range adaptor object_ is a customization point object
([customization.point.object]{.sref}) that accepts a `viewable_足range` as its
first argument and returns a `view`.

[3]{.pnum}
If a range adaptor object accepts only one argument, then it is a range adaptor
closure object.

::: rm
[4]{.pnum}
If a range adaptor object accepts more than one argument, then the following
expressions are equivalent:

```c++
adaptor(range, args...)
adaptor(args...)(range)
range | adaptor(args...)
```

In this case, `adaptor(args...)` is a range adaptor closure object.

:::

::: add
[4]{.pnum}
If a range adaptor object `adaptor` accepts more than one argument, then let
`range` be an expression such that `decltype((range))` models
`viewable_足range`, let `args...` be arguments such that
`adaptor(range, args...)` is a well-formed expression as specified in the rest
of this subclause ([range.adaptors]{.sref}), and let `BoundArgs` be a pack that
denotes `decay_t<decltype((args))>...`. The expression `adaptor(args...)`
produces a range adaptor closure object `f` that is a perfect forwarding call wrapper
with the following properties:

- Its target object is a copy of `adaptor`.
- Its bound argument entities `bound_args` consist of objects of types `BoundArgs...`
  direct-non-list-initialized with `std::forward<decltype((args))>(args)...`, respectively.
- Its call pattern is `adapter(r, bound_args...)`, where `r` is the argument
  used in a function call expression of `f`.

The expression `adaptor(args...)` is well-formed if and only if the
initialization of the bound argument entities of the result, as specified above,
are all well-formed.
