# Abstract
This paper provides wording to clean up [thread.lock]{.sref} and resolve [@LWG2363].

# Revision history

- R1: Rebased wording onto [@N4868]. Removed "open issues" section.

# Drafting notes
The original complaint of [@LWG2363] (a nonexistent _SharedTimedMutex_ named
requirement) has since been editorially resolved, and since these requirements
are only intended to be used for standard library types rather than user code,
I don't see a need to promote them to _CamelCased_ named requirements as in the
current PR.

However, the previous drafting did reveal additional issues:

1. the current WP says that `shared_lock<Mutex>` requires `Mutex` to meet the
   "shared mutex requirements [thread.sharedtimedmutex.requirements]{.sref}"; this is a mismatch
   and also seemingly makes `shared_lock<shared_mutex>` undefined behavior outright even if
   the user doesn't call the timed wait functions.
2. the current wording for `shared_lock` appears to disallow user-defined
   shared mutex types, because it references our internal requirements. This is a clear defect.
3. There is a pervasive problem throughout [thread.lock]{.sref} that conflates the
   preconditions of lock operations with the preconditions of the underlying
   lockable operations, and also confuses lockables with mutexes. The locks
   operate on lockables, so it's a category error to ask whether the lockable is
   a "recursive mutex" (not to mention that this term is never properly defined);
   we should just forward to the underlying lockable and let that operation do
   whatever it does, whether that's properly recursive locking, throwing an
   exception, or impregnating someone's nonexistent cat.

The wording below introduces new _Cpp17SharedLockable_ and _Cpp17SharedTimedLockable_ named
requirements. I decided to add the _Cpp17_ prefix because they deal with components added
in C++17. Because the existing _Cpp17MeowLockable_ requirements are very explicit that they
do not deal with the nature of any lock ownership, the same is true for the new requirements. As
far as the lockable requirements are concerned, "shared" and "non-shared" locks are
distinguished solely by the functions used to acquire them.

As discussed above, the wording removes most explicit preconditions on lock
constructors that are of the form "the calling thread does not own the mutex";
when instantiated with types that do not support recursive locking (and consider
such attempts undefined behavior), this precondition is implicitly imposed by
the call to the locking functions the constructors are specified to perform.

The `adopt_lock_t` overloads retain their precondition that the lock has been
acquired, but re-expressed in lockable terms. This is not strictly necessary -
failure to lock results in a precondition violation when the unlocking occurs -
but appears to be harmless and potentially permits early diagnosis.

# Wording
This wording is relative to [@N4868].

::: wordinglist

- Edit [thread.req.lockable.general]{.sref} p3 as indicated:

[3]{.pnum} The standard library templates `unique_­lock` ([thread.lock.unique]{.sref}),
`shared_­lock` ([thread.lock.shared]{.sref}),
`scoped_­lock` ([thread.lock.scoped]{.sref}),
`lock_­guard` ([thread.lock.guard]{.sref}),
`lock`, `try_­lock` ([thread.lock.algorithm]{.sref}),
and `condition_­variable_­any` ([thread.condition.condvarany]{.sref})
all operate on user-supplied lockable objects.
The _Cpp17BasicLockable_ requirements, the _Cpp17Lockable_ requirements,
[and]{.diffdel} the _Cpp17TimedLockable_
requirements[, the _Cpp17SharedLockable_ requirements, and the _Cpp17SharedTimedLockable_ requirements]{.diffins}
list the requirements imposed by these library types in order to acquire or release ownership of a lock
by a given execution agent.

[The nature of any lock ownership and any synchronization it entails are not part of these requirements.]{.note3}

- Add the following paragraph at the end of [thread.req.lockable.general]{.sref}:

::: add

[4]{.pnum} A lock on an object `m` is said to be a _non-shared lock_ if it is acquired by a call
to `lock`, `try_lock`, `try_lock_for`, or `try_lock_until` on `m`, and a _shared lock_
if it is acquired by a call to `lock_shared`, `try_lock_shared`, `try_lock_shared_for`,
or `try_lock_shared_until` on `m`.

[Only the method of lock acquisition is considered;
the nature of any lock ownership is not part of these definitions.]{.note}

:::

- Edit [thread.req.lockable.basic]{.sref} p3 and p4 as indicated:

::: itemdecl

```c++
m.unlock()
```

[3]{.pnum} _Preconditions:_ The current execution agent holds a [non-shared]{.diffins}
lock on `m` .

[4]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Releases a [non-shared]{.diffins} lock on `m` held by the current execution agent.

[5]{.pnum} _Throws:_ Nothing.

:::

- Add the following subclauses under [thread.req.lockable]{.sref}:

::: add

### ?.?.?.? _Cpp17SharedLockable_ requirements [thread.req.lockable.shared] {-}

[1]{.pnum} A type `L` meets the _Cpp17SharedLockable_ requirements
if the following expressions are well-formed,
have the specified semantics,
and the expression `m.try_lock_shared()` has type `bool`
(`m` denotes a value of type `L`):

::: itemdecl
```c++
m.lock_shared()
```

[2]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Blocks until a lock can be acquired for the current
execution agent. If an exception is thrown then a lock shall not have been
acquired for the current execution agent.

```c++
m.try_lock_shared()
```

[3]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Attempts to acquire a lock for the current execution agent
without blocking. If an exception is thrown then a lock shall not have been
acquired for the current execution agent.

[4]{.pnum} _Returns_: `true` if the lock was acquired, `false` otherwise.

```c++
m.unlock_shared()
```

[5]{.pnum} _Preconditions:_ The current execution agent holds a shared lock on `m`.

[6]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Releases a shared lock on `m` held by the current execution agent.

[7]{.pnum} _Throws:_ Nothing.

:::

### ?.?.?.? _Cpp17SharedTimedLockable_ requirements [thread.req.lockable.shared.timed] {-}

[1]{.pnum} A type `L` meets the _Cpp17SharedTimedLockable_ requirements if it meets
the _Cpp17SharedLockable_ requirements,
and the following expressions are well-formed, have type `bool`, and have the specified semantics
(`m` denotes a value of type `L`,  `rel_­time` denotes a value of a specialization
of `duration`, and `abs_­time` denotes a value of a specialization of `time_­point`):

::: itemdecl
```c++
m.try_lock_shared_for(rel_time)
```

[2]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Attempts to acquire a lock for the current execution agent
within the relative timeout ([thread.req.timing]{.sref}) specified by `rel_­time`.
The function will not return within the timeout specified by `rel_­time` unless it
has obtained a lock on `m` for the current execution agent. If an exception is
thrown then a lock has not been acquired for the current execution agent.

[3]{.pnum} _Returns_: `true` if the lock was acquired, `false` otherwise.

```c++
m.try_lock_shared_until(abs_time)
```

[4]{.pnum} _Effects:_ Attempts to acquire a lock for the current execution agent
before the absolute timeout ([thread.req.timing]{.sref}) specified by `abs_­time`.
The function will not return before the timeout specified by `abs_­time` unless it
has obtained a lock on `m` for the current execution agent. If an exception is
thrown then a lock has not been acquired for the current execution agent.

[5]{.pnum} _Returns_: `true` if the lock was acquired, `false` otherwise.

- Edit [thread.lock.shared.general]{.sref} as indicated:

[1]{.pnum} An object of type `shared_­lock` controls the shared ownership of a
lockable object within a scope. Shared ownership of the lockable object may be
acquired at construction or after construction, and may be transferred, after
acquisition, to another `shared_­lock` object. Objects of type `shared_­lock` are
not copyable but are movable. The behavior of a program is undefined if the
contained pointer `pm` is not null and the lockable object pointed to by `pm`
does not exist for the entire remaining lifetime ([basic.life]{.sref}) of the
`shared_­lock` object. The supplied `Mutex` type shall meet the
[shared mutex]{.diffdel} [_Cpp17SharedLockable_]{.diffins} requirements
([[thread.sharedtimedmutex.requirements]{.sref}]{.diffdel} [?.?.?.? \[thread.req.lockable.shared\]]{.diffins}).
